# Models and Simulations (CMPU250)

Here is a collection of homework assignments of models and simulations I built as
projects for Vassar's CMPU250.

## Homework 1
- Exponential decay to model radioactive decay
- Monte Carlo simulation to approximate Pi

## Homework 2
- Population dynamics

## Homework 3
- Projectile firing model using Runga-Kutta 4 approximation of position
- Hodgkin-Huxley model of neuron action potential

## Final project
- Thermodynamics model of heat transfer in a computer case
